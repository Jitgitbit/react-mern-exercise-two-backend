git init

npm init
npm install --save express body-parser
npm install --save-dev nodemon
npm install --save uuid

NOTE: Use PostMan ! check screenshot !

npm uninstall uuid                               (------->   also delete manually the uuid folder in node_modules !!!)
npm install uuidv4

npm install --save express validator

! had to delete the uuid folder a second time !?
! once more had issues with uuid, each time I do an npm install of anything, the uuid folder reappears, deleting is required !
