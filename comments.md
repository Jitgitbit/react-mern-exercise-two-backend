npm uninstall uuid                               (------->   also delete manually the uuid folder in node_modules !!!)
npm install uuidv4

npm install --save express validator

! had to delete the uuid folder a second time !?
! once more had issues with uuid, each time I do an npm install of anything, the uuid folder reappears, deleting is required !

brew update && brew upgrade node && npm install -g npm   (updating node)

npm install express-validator
! and again removing uuid folder in node_modules !

npm install axios
! and again removing uuid folder in node_modules ! removed uuid from package.json !

npm install uuid --------- npm uninstall uuid: uuid has a shitload of issues these days !!!

npm install uuidv1

npm install fs-extra
